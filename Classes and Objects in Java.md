Classes and Objects in Java
In Java, a class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) of objects. An object is a real-world instance of a class, representing a specific entity with actual values. For example, if a class is a design of a house, then an object is the actual house built from that design.

Classes and objects are central to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), enabling encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. They help break complex programs into smaller, reusable components.

Constructors initialize objects, methods define behavior, and attributes (or fields) hold data. Together, they allow modular, maintainable code that models real-life concepts.
